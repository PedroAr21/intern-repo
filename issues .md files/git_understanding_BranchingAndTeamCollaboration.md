Why is pushing directly to main problematic?
Pushing directly to main is problematic because it immediately changes the shared project version for everyone, overlooking review and risking the introduction of bugs or conflicts

How do branches help with reviewing code?
The branches let us create more fields where we can save changes before modifying the main project/repository on GitHub remote.

What happens if two people edit the same file on different branches?
They will get two different fields where they will be able to work separately without alter the main branch.
