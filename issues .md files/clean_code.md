1. Simplicity – Keep code as simple as possible.
The simpler the code, the easier it is to understand, test, and debug.
Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Benefits:
Reduces the likelihood of bugs.
Speeds up development and debugging.
Makes code easier to refactor.

2. Readability – Code should be easy to understand.
Code should be written in a way that is clear.
Anyone reading the code should be able to quickly grasp its purpose and functionality.

Benefits:
Reduces the time it takes to understand and work with the code.
Improves collaboration among developers.
Makes code easier to maintain.

3. Maintainability – Future developers (including you!) should be able to work with the code easily.
Code should be designed to be easily modified and extended.
It should be easy to fix bugs and add new features without introducing new problems.

Benefits:
Reduces the cost of software maintenance.
Makes it easier to adapt to changing requirements.

4. Consistency – Follow style guides and project conventions.
Code should be written in a consistent style throughout the project.
This makes it easier to read and understand.

Benefits:
Improves code readability.
Makes code easier to integrate.

5. Efficiency – Write performant, optimized code without premature over-engineering.
Code should be written to perform efficiently.
However, avoid premature optimization, which can lead to overly complex code.

Benefits:
Improves software performance.
Avoids making code overly complex when it is not needed.
