What does each command do?
git checkout main -- <file> : Restores the file from the main branch.
git cherry-pick <commit> : Makes the same summit from another branch without merging all the branch.
git log : Shows commit history.
git blame <file> : Shows Who modified the file and when.

When would you use it in a real project (hint: these are all really important in long running projects with multiple developers)?
When I send my changes or compare the changes from someone who worked in another file or branch, check updates, isolate the work before save changes in the main branch.

What surprised you while testing these commands?
The flexibility that GitHub gives and how teams can be more productives in the workspace with these commmands.
