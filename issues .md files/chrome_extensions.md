Which extensions did you install? Why?

React Developer Tools to inspect React components and understand how my application is structured. Also Redux DevTools to debug the state of Redux and see how actions flow. JSON Viewer helps me read and understand the responses of APIs, and Lighthouse allows me to analyze my applicationâ€™s performance and quality.

What was the most useful thing you learned?
The most useful thing I learned were the extensions that I will use to improve any app and follow them to check the performance.
