What is the difference between staging and committing?
Staging is select the changes we want to save, even it knows as the index, acts as a temporary holding place for these chosen changes. instead, committing is when we save the changes permanently to the Git directory, also it accompanied by a message describing the changes. 

Why does Git separate these two steps?
To be sure before save permanently changes.

When would you want to stage changes without committing?
When we want to save permanently changes to the GitHub repo
