Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

I have used git when in an asignature from my university shows about how to work in a team using git and push each change we did to complete a code prject.


Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I chose Git Bash and GitHub Desktop to benefit from both an intuitive interface for basic tasks and a powerful command-line environment for more complex operations.


What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

The most interesting thing I learned about Git today is how it allows us to experiment with changes without fear of losing our previous work. This makes it much easier to improve our projects and only share those changes once we're certain they're ready.
